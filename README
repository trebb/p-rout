P-rout
======

P-rout may be useful for ownwers of one of the various types of a
solar energy appliance called Powerrouter, manufactured by Nedap
N.V.

The appliance is connected to the Internet and uploads data to an HTTP
server (logging1.powerrouter.com) that is owned by the manufacturer,
who provides another HTTP server where customers can view their data.

This project does basically the same while keeping everything on the
owner's premises.  It provides a data-collecting HTTP server where the
Powerrouter can upload.  Data is stored in a PostgreSQL database and
can be reviewed on a second HTTP server.

P-rout is intended to be installed on a single-board computer.  It
currently lacks a decent installation procedure.


If there is already a configure file, run as usual
  ./configure && make && make install.

Otherwise, call
  autoreconf -vif
first which should create the configure file.

P-rout in its default configuration expects a local PostgreSQL
database named 'p_rout' where user 'p-rout' (password 'p-rout') has
administrative rights.
